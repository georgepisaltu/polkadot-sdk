//! # Stake Tracker Pallet
//!
//! The stake-tracker pallet is responsible to keep track of the voter's stake and target's approval
//! voting in the staking system.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The stake-tracker pallet listens to staking events through implementing the [`OnStakingUpdate`]
//! trait and, based on those events, ensures that the score of nodes in the lists
//! [`Config::VoterList`] and [`Config::TargetList`] are kept up to date with the staker's bonds
//! and nominations in the system. In addition, the pallet also ensures that both the
//! [`Config::TargetList`] and [`Config::VoterList`] are *strictly sorted* by
//! [`SortedListProvider::Score`].
//!
//! ## Goals
//!
//! The [`OnStakingUpdate`] implementation aims to achieve the following goals:
//!
//! * The [`Config::TargetList`] keeps a sorted list of validators, sorted by approvals
//! (which include self-vote and nominations' stake).
//! * The [`Config::VoterList`] keeps a sorted list of voters, sorted by bonded stake.
//! * The [`Config::TargetList`] sorting must be *always* kept up to date, even in the event of new
//! nomination updates, nominator/validator slashes and rewards. This pallet *must* ensure that the
//! scores of the targets  and voters are always up to date and thus, that the targets and voters in
//! the lists are sorted by score at all time.
//!
//! Note that from the POV of this pallet, all events will result in one or multiple updates to
//! [`Config::VoterList`] and/or [`Config::TargetList`] state. If a set of staking updates require
//! too much weight to execute (e.g. at nominator's rewards payout or at slashes), the event emitter
//! should handle that in some way (e.g. buffering events and implementing a multi-block event
//! emitter).
//!
//! ## Staker status and list invariants
//!
//! There are a few invariants that depend on the staker's (nominator or validator) state, as
//! exposed by the [`Config::Staking`] interface:
//!
//! * A [`sp_staking::StakerStatus::Nominator`] is part of the voter list and its self-stake is the
//! voter list's score. In addition, the voters' scores are up to date with the current stake
//! returned by [`T::Staking::stake`].
//! * A [`sp_staking::StakerStatus::Validator`] is part of both voter and target list. And its
//! approvals score (nominations + self-stake) is kept up to date as the target list's score.
//! * A [`sp_staking::StakerStatus::Idle`] may have a target list's score while other stakers
//!   nominate the idle validator.
//! * A "dangling" target, which is not an active staker anymore (i.e. not bonded), may still have
//!   an associated target list score. This may happen when active nominators are still nominating
//!   the target after the validator unbonded. The target list's node and score will automatically
//!   be removed onced all the voters stop nominating the unbonded account (i.e. the target's score
//!   drops to 0).
//!
//! For further details on the target list invariantes, refer to [`Self`::do_try_state_approvals`]
//! and [`Self::do_try_state_target_sorting`].
//!
//! ## Event emitter ordering and staking ledger state updates
//!
//! It is important to ensure that the events are emitted from staking (i.e. the calls into
//! [`OnStakingUpdate`]) *after* the staking ledger has been updated by the caller, since the new
//! state will be fetched and used to update the sorted lists accordingly.
